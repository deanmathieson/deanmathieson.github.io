                To figure out what you want in a partner and go out there and

            <p>
              Truly joyful, happy relationships have two people that know what
              they want in their partners. They know the difference between
              infatuation and love. They know how to overcome the bumps in the
              road when they get to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are <strong>FOCUSED</strong> on communication, intimacy, and
              keeping the spark alive. They know what they want from a
              relationship and what their partner wants as well. And because of
              this
              <strong>their relationship succeeds in the long term</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              And yet we tend to lose hope so easily when it comes to having a
              successful relationship. We give up because we think it's too
              hard.

              In 20 years, you could look back on THIS as the time when you
              finally realized you were capable of a successful long-term
              relationship.
            </p>
            <p><em>When you accepted love.</em></p>
            <p>
              When you stopped being held back by your past relationships,
              discouraged because you didn't understand what love was, and
              developed the relationship you were DESTINED to have.
            </p>
            <p>This is your moment.</p>

              <p>
                You read about it in books; you sing about it songs. Romantic
                movies are based upon it. You've probably felt it yourself. The
                "it" is love's first bite, that feeling of being heads over
                heels in love with someone. But in order to know if a person is
                right for you, you need to know the difference between true love
                and the chemicals your body produces. That's what this lesson is
                all about.

                The chemicals in your brain aren't the only aspect of
                attraction. How you grew up, your relationship with your family,
                and the beliefs you formed about relationships are major factors
                in who you're attracted to. This lesson will help you look at
                some of those influences and understand how they influence who
                you are today.

                Relationships are the most fulfilling and the most painful
                teachers in life. In relationships you learn the type of people
                you are attracted to and what characteristics drive you crazy.
                But here's the thing: if you don't love yourself, you're prone
                to making relationship mistakes. This lesson is going to help
                you determine whether you truly love yourself.

                childhood, that the chemicals your body produces have a powerful
                effect upon your feelings, and that your self-image is important
                in choosing a partner. It's time to reflect on what you've

                For a relationship to be successful, you need to understand both
                physical and emotional intimacy. Some people want physical
                intimacy more than emotional, and vice versa. This module will
                help you understand what you want in terms of intimacy and teach
                you to understand what others want as well.

                can have a massive impact on your relationship. In this lesson
                you'll learn more about key communication strategies and the

              <h3>Lesson #17 - What's Your Programming?</h3>
              <p>
                As much as you've worked on overcoming what you might call
                "negative patterns," there is one specific time they pop up
                again: During times of stress. Stress can throw you back into
                the past. Reverting to unhealthy behavior patterns can damage
                your relationship. This lesson will help you prepare for times
                of stress so you can respond in a healthy and supportive manner.

              <h3>Lesson #18 - Is it a Mistake or a Pattern?</h3>
              <p>
                In this lesson, you'll discover the difference between mistakes
                and patterns. A mistake is something everyone makes. It happens
                once, perhaps twice, and you learn from it. A pattern is an
                ingrained way of behaving which is difficult to change. You're
                going to learn to identify the patterns in your life so you can
                eliminate them in the future.

              <h3>Lesson #19 - What Are Your Non-Negotiables?</h3>
              <p>
                Leading up to this lesson, you've spent a lot of time reflecting
                on what you really want in a relationship. Now it's time to
                decide on your non-negotiables. This lesson will help you map
                out the things that you absolutely must have in a relationship,
                as well as the things that aren't as important.

              <h3>Lesson #20 - Confronting Hurt And Disappointment</h3>
              <p>
                Relationships can change in an instant due to the hidden
                emotional minefield within everyone. Every relationship will
                have some measure of hurt and disappointment. It's simply how
                relationships are. But you can learn to confront those things in
                healthy ways that actually strengthen your relationship. That's
                what you'll learn in this lesson.

              <h3>Lesson #21 - Can You Forgive and Forget?</h3>
              <p>
                In the previous lesson, you examined ways to respond when things
                go wrong in your relationship. In this lesson you'll learn about
                forgiveness and releasing the pain of past hurts. The ability to
                forgive is key to having a healthy relationship, and this lesson
                will guide you through the steps necessary for forgiveness to
                happen.

              <p>
                You've been delving into some tough information. By the very
                nature of this course, you've looked at challenges and
                difficulties in relationships. When you focus on them, the
                tendency is to see only the challenges in relationships. The
                focus of this lesson is to examine whether you are ready for a
                committed long-term relationship. Relationships are truly
                wonderful, but you need to be willing to commit to them.

              <p>
                What you'll learn in this lesson is as important as the previous
                22 lessons. You'll find suggestions which have kept many a
                relationship strong through the difficult times.Life gets
                routine. You each have a daily routine of work and
                responsibilities. If you have children, they can take up much of
